# Food Origins

We're making the global food supply chain tangible.

## How?

By creating a tool to help people understand the global supply chain and how it affects them as they shop at their local supermarket. It's an app in which users can take a photo of the barcode on a food product and immediately see the countries from which the ingredients were imported.

## Why?

It's easy to show someone a huge set of import and export data, but it's hard for people to translate that into a real understanding of the global food supply network. We want to empower users to discover this for themselves by giving them a tool to visualise the country of origin of each ingredient in the product that they're holding in their hand.
